🎵 Music Media Management System

Assignment 2 — Object Oriented Programming in Java

📌 Project Purpose

This project was created for Assignment 2 to demonstrate the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming principles in Java.

The system models a simple music management environment using songs, artists and playlists.

🚀 Key Features
1. Song Management

Create songs with title and duration.

Display song information using overridden toString().

Compare two songs using overridden equals() and hashCode().

2. Artist Management

Store artist name and genre.

Display artist information.

3. Playlist Management

Create playlists with song count.

Display playlist information.

4. Object-Oriented Principles

Encapsulation — all fields are private with getters and setters.

Inheritance — Song extends MediaItem.

Polymorphism — through method overriding and interface usage.

Abstraction — base class MediaItem represents common media behavior.

Overriding — toString(), equals(), hashCode().

Overloading — multiple constructors.

Interface implementation — for media behavior.

5. Data Processing

Store songs in an array.

Search songs by title.

Filter songs by duration.

Display all stored songs.

🧩 Project Structure
File	Description
MediaItem.java	Base class for media objects
Song.java	Represents a song
Artist.java	Represents an artist
Playlist.java	Represents a playlist
Playable.java	Interface for playable media
Main.java	Program entry point
